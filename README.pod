GpfMeter - Grounded Performance Feedback Meter

=head1 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

An area that has proven to be rather difficult to tackle in performance
monitoring is desktop performance. At the same time, this is where the
rubber hits the road. Even when my performance monitor tells me that the
desktop performance is fine, what matters at the end of the day is if the
users feel comfortable with their desktop performance.

So instead of throwing ever larger amounts of technology at the 'problem'
GpfMeter centers on the user experience. And provides the user with a very
simple way of reporting problems:

Whenever the user is unhappy about some technical aspect of the IT
environment, GpfMeter is just one click away.

While the user is providing information about the problem from the human
perspective, the GpfMeter will record the system status in the background. 
Currently this includes:

=item * an optional screenshot

=item * a detailed process list

=item * http(s) connection timing to a configurable list of targets

=back

All the information is then bundled into an email which is sent to the
support team for further processing.  Obviously the system will only work
when the reports are processed by other humans who respond and take care of
improving the user experience.

=head1 INSTALLATION

GpfMeter is targeted at Windows users. For easy deployment it is written in
C#.  You should be able to import this repository into VisualStudio and
compile your own GpfMeter.

Upon startup a configuration file GpfMeterConfig.json is created in
the directory where the GpfMeter executable resides. In this file you
can modify most contents of the GpfMeter window, list the URLs of the
sites to be probed, and specify where mails are sent to.

After modification of the config file GpfMeter must be restarted for
the changes to become effective.

=head1 USAGE

The program is probably best started automatically upon login. An icon
is placed into the Windows notification area. When the icon is clicked
a window is opened where users can optionally explain their
unhappiness in some detail and then submit their complaint.
